#bem.info goes mobile

Hi everyone!

Sometime ago our users asked us to improve [bem.info](https://en.bem.info) for mobile devices. And while we are awaiting a new truly mobile design, we tried our best to improve our current version. You can check [bem.info](https://en.bem.info) from your mobile phone or tablet now and see what we have got for the meantime. 

We concentrated on availability of the content (articles, documentation, etc.) on a small screen. To ease reading, we hid some elements that are available in our desktop version.

The way it works:
  * Magic begins with device windows size smaller than 980px.
  * We have only desktop bem.info version now for all device types; therefore, we implement all required functionality in the mobile version using media-query.
  * To make a main menu friendly and usable, we added a control element into a header to open and close the menu easily;
  * The header doesn't stick to the top of the page anymore and give us some more space. Now in mobile browsers, one click on the window title returns you to the top of the screen. So, there is no need to show the title all the time.

What we plan:
  * Get back search.
  * Add an option of opening desktop version on mobile devices.
  * Get users feedback and improve our next mobile version accordingly.

As we mentioned above, this mobile version is transitional. We would be happy to hear all your wishes, notes and propositions to improve the next version.

Respectfully yours,

BEM Development Team

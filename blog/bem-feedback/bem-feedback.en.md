# BEM form: projects and feedback

Hi!

We start with “thank you” note: we would like to thank you so much for using our BEM technology, support us, ask questions on 
social media and [our forum](https://en.bem.info/forum/), help us not only develop and improve our technologies, but build your 
own projects and products using BEM and contribute to the community development. 

Today we would like to ask you, BEM developers, for a very important favour — to find some time and fill in the questionnaire 
with the experience you have got. 

We ask there very important and useful for the technology development questions, answers to those will help us know you and 
your projects better, find out problems you face using it and understand what you need in the first place. 

We analyse all the answers and dedicate our efforts to technology and infrastructure improvements to ease your interactions 
with it. 

All the results we have got will be published in our [blog](https://en.bem.info/blog/). 

Feedback is available in both [English](https://en.bem.info/feedback/) and [Russian](https://ru.bem.info/feedback/) languages, 
however, you need to choose **only one** because there is a common storage for the answers. 

We will be very much thankful as well if you could possibly forward a link to the questionnaire to your colleagues and friends 
who use BEM in their work. This allows us to gather as much useful and important feedback as possible. 

Thank you very much in advance, and **Stay BEMed**!

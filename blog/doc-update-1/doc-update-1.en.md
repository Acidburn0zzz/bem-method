# Documentation update: bem-components

Hi,

We have good news for you — we improved existing documentation for [bem-components](https://ru.bem.info/libs/bem-components/) library.

Not so long ago we conducted a survey and found out what would be useful to add to the blocks library description. We have analysed your responses and implemented many of your wishes in our new documentation!

Here is the list of new features of documentation that were implemented:

* Now we are able to show source files of blocks from all levels involved in the assembly. To see links to all the files of the block from all levels, you need to open a new tab of the block description — ((https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/desktop/button/sources/ Sources)). Thus, for example, for a desktop block there will be a set of files from desktop and common levels.
* We are able to show additional levels for the complex block examples from an ”Examples“ tab. For this we created a separate tab called ”custom blocks“ that contains links to all additional files.
* We also are able to show the dependencies for all examples in ”deps“ tab.
* We now highlight and format all code examples. We add formatting and highlighting of the code in BEMJSON and HTML tabs.
* And finally we are able to show HTML for custom examples in ”Examples“ tab.

Hope these new updates will be useful!

And of course, we want to thank all the respondents who participated in a survey! Your answers helped us dramatically in improvement of the documentation and understanding what is really important to you.

We also added a permanent [feedback tab](https://en.bem.info/feedback/) on the main menu to give you a tool to report us what you think back any time you like. You can do this by mail as well: [info@bem.info](mailto:info@bem.info).

Enjoy usage and **Stay BEMed!**

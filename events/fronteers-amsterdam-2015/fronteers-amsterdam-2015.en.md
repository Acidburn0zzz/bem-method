# BEM talks at Fronteers 2015 Jam Session

**When**: October 7, 2015

**Where**: [Kapitein Zeppos](http://www.zeppos.nl/), Amsterdam, The Netherlands

No [Fronteers conference](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2015/) would be the same without [the Jam Session](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2015/jam-session)
to kick things off the night before. That is why a lot of developers apply to talk at Jam and are very happy when they are chosen. 

We thrilled to announce that two of our talks are accepted to a program of a six year tradition of Jam Session.

More information about the event could be found on [it's official web page](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2015/jam-session).
